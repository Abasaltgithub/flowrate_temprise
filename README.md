# FlowRateTempRise
This code contains two sections that perform calculations related to fluid dynamics and electrical resistance.

Fluid dynamics: The first section calculates the pressure drop in a pipe as a function of flow rate using the Darcy-Weisbach equation and the Colebrook equation. The parameters used in the calculation are the pipe diameter, length, absolute roughness, and density of water. The results are plotted as a graph showing the pressure drop versus the flow rate.

Electrical resistance: The second section calculates the temperature rise in a wire wound in a coil as a function of water flow rate. The parameters used in the calculation are the internal diameter of the coil, wire diameter, number of axial and radial turns, resistivity of the wire, and water flow rate. The results are plotted as a graph showing the temperature rise versus the water flow rate.
At the end of the notebook, a table is printed showing the internal and outer diameters of the coil, the total wire length, the total resistance, and the total dissipated power.
